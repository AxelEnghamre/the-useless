# Code Review

1. `style.css:1` - The font might be a bit hard to read, consider using it only as heading and  something more legible in main instead.
1. `hydrateSelect.js:1-2` - Some comments are not that detailed, they could be more elaborate to fully piece together code in different files.
1. `Main.js:61 ` - Just a typo in the comment: “when bottom of the window is near bottom of the bottom of the main”.
